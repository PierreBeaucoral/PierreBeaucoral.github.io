title: "Under the Green Canopy: bringing up to date public climate finance determinants analysis with AI"
summary: >
  Climate finance is critical for addressing the multifaceted challenges of climate change, encompassing mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. This study aims to renew the analysis of a critical part of climate finance determinants' allocation across these dimensions and accurately estimate bilateral public climate finance flows using an advanced machine learning approach. ClimateFinanceBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is employed to classify development finance projects, distinguishing those that contribute to climate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental objectives. By examining a comprehensive dataset of development finance projects (OECD CRS) and replicating a recent research on climate public aid determinants, this study identifies key factors influencing the allocation of climate finance. This work updates significant patterns in climate finance distribution. This research contributes to the growing field of climate finance by offering a robust analytical framework for assessing the determinants of climate finance and proposing a scalable solution for monitoring financial flows aimed at addressing climate change in its entirety. The insights gained have important implications for policymakers and stakeholders striving to understand and optimize the allocation of climate finance to support global sustainability and resilience goals.

# Further Explanations

Climate finance plays a crucial role in combating climate change, addressing mitigation, adaptation, and environmental goals. However, traditional methods of analyzing and categorizing these financial flows often rely on self-reported data and broad categorizations, which can lead to inaccuracies and overreporting.

This study uses ClimateFinanceBERT, an advanced AI-based approach to analyze and classify climate-related financial flows with unprecedented precision. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the study processes over 1.3 million development finance projects from the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), identifying climate-relevant projects and categorizing them into mitigation, adaptation, and environmental domains. The two-stage classification approach significantly enhances the accuracy of estimating climate finance and its determinants compared to traditional methods like the Rio markers.

# Key Findings
**Adaptation Finance**:

Allocation is increasingly driven by recipient vulnerability and institutional capacity, prioritizing small island developing states (SIDS) and least-developed countries (LDCs).
Historical ties, such as colonial relationships or shared languages, show little to no significance in influencing adaptation finance.
Countries with strong governance and public administration frameworks receive more adaptation aid, highlighting the importance of institutional capacity over fiscal management.

**Mitigation Finance**:

While historical ties like colonial relationships and shared languages still play a role, their influence has significantly weakened under more rigorous AI-driven analysis.
Mitigation funding decisions align more closely with quantifiable outcomes, such as greenhouse gas reductions, resulting in a standardized allocation process.
Governance indicators are less critical compared to adaptation finance, reflecting the technical and infrastructure-focused nature of mitigation projects.

**Disparities in Traditional Estimates**:

The study reveals significant overreporting in conventional climate finance estimates, particularly for adaptation projects. This is attributed to methodological biases in traditional classification systems, which often categorize non-climate projects as climate-related.
Using ClimateFinanceBERT, the study identifies a ten-year delay in achieving the $100 billion annual global climate finance target based on adjusted estimates, with the target potentially reached only by 2032 under current trends.

# Implications for Policy and Practice

The findings underline the need for more nuanced and data-driven approaches to climate finance allocation. Policymakers and stakeholders should consider the following:

**Differentiated Strategies**: Adaptation finance should prioritize vulnerability and capacity-building, while mitigation finance can benefit from standardized allocation frameworks aligned with measurable targets.

**Improved Transparency**: The reliance on outdated classification systems like the Rio markers highlights the need for adopting AI tools like ClimateFinanceBERT to enhance the accuracy and accountability of climate finance reporting.

**Capacity Building**: Donors should invest in strengthening institutional capacities in vulnerable regions to improve the effectiveness of adaptation projects.

This study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in analyzing climate finance, paving the way for more equitable and impactful distribution of resources. Future research should expand this methodology to multilateral and private financial flows to provide a comprehensive view of climate finance dynamics and ensure resources align with global sustainability goals.
