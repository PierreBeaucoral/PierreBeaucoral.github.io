More informal or funnier way to get an idea of the same research project thanks to suno? here it is!

## What is Suno? 
Suno AI, or simply Suno, is an innovative artificial intelligence music creation program designed to produce lifelike songs incorporating vocals and instrumentation, or solely instrumental compositions. Widely accessible since December 20, 2023, Suno was introduced through a web application launch and a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which integrated Suno as a plugin in Microsoft Copilot. This program operates by generating songs based on textual prompts provided by users. While Suno keeps its training dataset undisclosed, it assures users of measures taken to prevent plagiarism and copyright infringements.


## How did I use it? 

I use the summary of my research project on NLP and the OECD CRS dataset and give some instructions about the style (initially "old emotional rap"), then I let the machine do the maths and here is the result:
